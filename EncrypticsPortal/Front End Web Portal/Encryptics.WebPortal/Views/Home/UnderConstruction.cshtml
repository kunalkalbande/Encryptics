<h3>In the mean time we suggest the following:</h3>
<ol class="round">
    <li class="one">
        <h5>Don't have an account? Register now!</h5>
        <a href="@string.Format("{0}/NewUser", ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EncrypticsWebSite"])">Register</a> now for an Encryptics® account and then activate your devices in a matter of minutes.
    </li>

    <li class="two">
        <h5>Forget your password?</h5>
        If you've forgotten your password, you can <a href="@string.Format("{0}/ForgotPassword.aspx", ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["EncrypticsWebSite"])">Request a Reset</a>.
    </li>

    <li class="three">
        <h5>Didn't receive your Activation Link email?</h5>
        If you haven't received an email within 30 minutes of registering, you can @Html.ActionLink("Resend Activation Link", "Resend", "Account").
    </li>
</ol>
